# Improved Prompt: Building a Premium Modern Salon Website in React

Enhance and refine the original prompt for clarity, completeness, structure, and feasibility. Additions include: React Router for multi-page navigation, state management for themes/forms, explicit performance optimizations, and ensured compatibility across tools. Removed redundancies, improved flow, and made instructions more actionable for developers or AI code generation.

## Objective
Create a premium, modern, fully responsive salon website with a luxurious beauty aesthetic, featuring elegant animations, smooth transitions, and interactive elements. Focus on user experience, performance, and code quality.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- React.js (v18+, functional components with hooks)
- React Router (for client-side routing and navigation)
- Tailwind CSS (for responsive, utility-first styling)
- Framer Motion (primary for animations and transitions)
- GSAP (optional for complex parallax or timeline-based effects)
- Swiper.js or Embla Carousel (for sliders and carousels)
- React Hook Form + Zod (for form validation and handling)
- Lucide-react or React Icons (for scalable icons)
- Context API or Zustand (lightweight state management for theme toggle and global states)

## 🎨 Visual Style & UX
- Elegant, feminine/modern beauty theme with soft pastels, gold accents, and minimalism.
- Incorporate soft gradients, glassmorphism (frosted glass effects on cards), subtle glows, and premium typography (e.g., Google Fonts like Playfair Display for headings, Roboto for body).
- Dark/light mode toggle with smooth theme transitions (stored in localStorage).
- Micro-interactions: Hover effects (scale, shadow lift), button ripples, and icon animations.
- Scroll-triggered animations, parallax scrolling for depth, and easing curves for fluidity.
- Fully responsive: Desktop (>1024px), tablet (768-1024px), mobile (<768px) with mobile-first design.

## 🧩 Pages & Sections
Implement as separate routes using React Router (e.g., /home, /services, /about). Include a persistent navbar with logo, menu (hamburger on mobile), theme toggle, and booking CTA. Use lazy loading for pages.

1. **Hero Section (Home Page)**
   - Full-screen hero with high-res background image/video (from Unsplash/Pexels, lazy-loaded).
   - Animated headline ("Enhance Your Natural Beauty"), subtitle, and prominent CTA button.
   - Floating booking button with pulse animation, fixed on scroll.

2. **Services**
   - Grid of animated service cards (e.g., Hair, Makeup, Skin, Nails, Bridal, Spa, Grooming).
   - Hover overlays revealing details/icons; staggered fade-in on load.

3. **About the Salon**
   - Split layout: Image on one side, storytelling copy on the other.
   - Animated stats counters (e.g., 10+ years, 5000+ clients, 20+ artists, awards).
   - Interactive timeline of salon history with scroll-triggered reveals.

4. **Signature Treatments**
   - Showcase premium services with before/after image sliders.
   - Hover zoom effects and animated comparison reveals.

5. **Team / Stylists**
   - Grid of profile cards with photos, bios, specialties, and certifications.
   - Hover to reveal social links and direct booking buttons.

6. **Gallery / Portfolio**
   - Masonry grid layout (use CSS Grid or react-masonry-component if needed).
   - Filter by categories (Hair, Makeup, Bridal, Spa, Nails) with smooth transitions.
   - Lightbox modal for full-view: Zoom, swipe navigation, fade-in animations. Use Unsplash/Pexels images.

7. **Testimonials**
   - Carousel slider with client avatars, star ratings, and quotes.
   - Auto-play with fade/slide transitions; pause on hover.

8. **Pricing & Packages**
   - Tiered pricing cards for services and packages (e.g., basic, premium, bridal).
   - Highlight popular plans with glow borders and animated CTAs on hover.

9. **Online Booking / Contact**
   - Multi-step form with React Hook Form: Select service, stylist, date/time (use react-datepicker).
   - Real-time validation with Zod; success animation (confetti or fade-out) on submit.
   - Floating WhatsApp/Call buttons with tooltips.

10. **Location & Hours**
    - Embedded Google Maps iframe with scroll-reveal animation.
    - Display address, hours, and parking details in a clean card.

11. **Offers & Memberships**
    - Promo banners for deals, loyalty programs, and referrals.
    - Animated cards with countdown timers for limited offers.

12. **Trust & Social Proof**
    - Slider or marquee of brand logos, certifications, awards, and influencer shoutouts.
    - Fade-in animations on scroll.

13. **Footer (Global)**
    - Social media icons with hover scale/rotate.
    - Newsletter signup form (integrated with React Hook Form).
    - Quick links to pages, privacy policy, terms, and copyright.

## ✨ Animation Requirements
- **Entrance**: Fade-in/up on page load with stagger for lists/grids.
- **Scroll-Triggered**: Use Framer Motion's useInView for reveals (e.g., slide from left/right, scale up).
- **Hover/Interactions**: Scale, opacity changes, and icon bounces with spring physics.
- **Transitions**: Smooth easing (e.g., easeInOut); modals with scale-from-center.
- **Parallax**: Subtle background shifts on scroll (GSAP if complex).

## 🧪 Performance & Code Quality
- Modular components: Break into reusable atoms (Button, Card) and molecules (ServiceCard).
- Folder Structure: src/components/, src/pages/, src/assets/, src/utils/, src/hooks/.
- SEO: Use React Helmet for meta tags; semantic HTML (h1-h6, alt texts).
- Optimization: Lazy load images/components with React.lazy; code-splitting for routes.
- Accessibility: ARIA attributes, keyboard nav, 4.5:1 color contrast, screen-reader friendly.
- Testing: Basic unit tests for forms/animations (optional with Jest).
- No external APIs beyond specified; mock form submissions.

## 📦 Deliverables
- Full React project zipped or in a GitHub repo structure.
- All components, styles, animations, and routes implemented.
- Responsive across devices; tested on Chrome/Firefox/Safari.
- Use real Unsplash/Pexels URLs for images (e.g., via import or img src).
- Clean, commented, maintainable code with ESLint/Prettier formatting.
- README with setup instructions: `npm install`, `npm start`.
